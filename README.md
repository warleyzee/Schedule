# Dynamic Agenda in Node.js
The project consists of a dynamic agenda developed entirely in Node.js, utilizing the latest methodologies and practices of this development platform. Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that enables developers to create scalable, high-performance network applications. Its main features include being asynchronous and event-driven, making it ideal for real-time applications.

## Node.js Methodologies:
Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.js is known for its asynchronous and event-driven nature. This means that input/output operations, such as file reading or database queries, do not block code execution. Instead, Node.js uses callbacks, Promises, or async/await to handle these operations efficiently, allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while awaiting the result.

### Native Modules and Package Management:
Node.js has a vast ecosystem of native modules and third-party libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager). Developers can easily incorporate additional functionalities into their projects, saving time and effort in development.


### Express.js: 
Express.js is a minimalist and flexible web framework for Node.js, widely used for creating web applications and APIs. It provides a thin layer of essential features for web applications, allowing developers to quickly create routes, middleware, and request handlers.
NoSQL Database: For this project, we will explore the use of a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB, which is a common choice for Node.js applications due to its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB allows storing data in a JSON-like format, making it easy to integrate with Node.js applications.

### Project Features:
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete): The application will allow users to perform basic CRUD operations to manage agenda items, such as adding new events, viewing existing events, updating information, and deleting events.
Dynamic Login System: A user authentication system will be implemented to secure access to the agenda. Users will be able to register, log in, and log out of their accounts. Authentication will be managed securely, using techniques such as password hashing and session token generation.

This project aims to provide a solid foundation for Node.js application development, covering everything from creating a basic application to implementing more advanced features like user authentication and database integration. It will serve as an opportunity to explore and apply best practices in Node.js development, preparing participants for more complex projects in the future.
